% Symbols Go Here
%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
% Format is:
% \newsymbentry{name}{symbol}{description}
% name should be in plain English, can have spaces
% symbol is the actual symbol DO NOT enclose in $$, that will be done automatically
% description is the entry in the list of symbols

% There is no reason to delete anything from this list. The assumption is that our symbols will be consistent throughout the course. So we can just keep adding to this list. If a symbol isn't used, it won't be printed in the list of symbols.

\newsymbentry{pi}{\pi}{ratio of circumference of circle to its
               diameter}
